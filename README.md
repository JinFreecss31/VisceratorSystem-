Hello! Please take a look only at main branch at ShortExplainOfVisceratorSystem, VisceratorSystemClientSide and VisceratorServerSideSystem!
Note : (First of all i can suggest you to read ShortExplainOfVisceratorSystem because there i've explained shortly how overall viscerator system works and why certain things were chosen to be used in this system like they are)
Be not afraid of large size of client size, in reality most of those lines are pretty easy and it is just me pretty bad at organaize things so...
Just watch quickly and if you wondering how things are work, i've placed short description to almost all lines where i think there should be!
(For Client SIde Script)
1st Part Variables
2nd Part Functions (First basic ones to help with main and then main ones which are used to directly change viscerator states and etc!)
3rd part will store almost all Connections which will be needed to then find out new states of certain stats and apply new changes according to changes and etc!
4th and shortest part of script will be all about set up and manualy change few things to fully prepare all system to function correctly and the way it meant to be!
(Most of explanation at first part of script, second one kind of empty sometimes as it is really easy to catch up what is going one, usually repetitive and simple Connections/Checks and Triggers!)
Last part about server. Well server will run only few simple functions and Connections so 
That is all for now i guess!
Hope you will check it! 
Even if i won't be given with chances to prove myself, still very happy to try!
Response, even in case i am failed, will be very appreciated and Thanks for Attention and Time!
